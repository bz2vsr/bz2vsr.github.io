everybody keeps getting COVID. Why is that? Ask yourself that question. And no, I don't believe that COVID is just the flu being reclassified. I don't believe that. But I'm not justifying the lockdowns either. I think it was shit. It wasn't handled quite as well as it could have been handled. The reason everybody kept getting COVID is because they kept getting the vaccines. You want to know why the flu never disappeared over all those decades and decades? Because people kept getting flu shots. The flu shots and any kind of vaccine doesn't get rid of disease. It perpetuates it. Hmm. Never thought of it that way. You should never get your kids vaccinated. Never. Never get your kids vaccinated. You know how much mercury they're pumping into your kids' blood when they give them vaccines? It's more than three times the amount that's considered poisonous. I thought mercury wasn't used anymore. It's still used, as far as I'm aware.
