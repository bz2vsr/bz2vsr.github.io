Should I go take edibles in honor of everyone else being high? Apparently everybody is. Is everyone high? I'm on mushrooms.

You're on mushrooms? Yeah, you missed it, Feared_1, we had a whole vegan debate. Xohmm asked if the mushrooms are still considered vegan if they're used with cow manure since that's technically an animal. An animal's not being exploited for that, you can find it.

I don't know. If they're making them poop by feeding them too much food, they're exploiting it. You don't need that much.
