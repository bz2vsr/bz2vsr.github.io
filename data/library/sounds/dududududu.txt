Oh, he says it's my cell phone, like reverberating into the fucking room. Oh, that? Yeah, I can hear that. It doesn't bother me, though. Really? It doesn't bother me, though. It doesn't bother me either, but like, it's a thing, and it's- But he's the only one who comments on it, so he is definitely bothered by it, you should continue doing it, Luminous. Yeah, but I'm not doing anything, the phone is not anywhere near my headset. It's impressive, actually. I mean, it should be, like, if it was somewhere on the table or desk, sure. It's literally, I would say, from my headset, maybe two feet from my headset. Oh, that's not very much at all, but okay.
